This project is an exercise that is part of the interview process for joining [Checkr](https://api.checkr.com).

#### Checkr Interview
## Climate Disasters exercise

This project consists of building two small services:

 - A simple REST API that gives access to natural disasters in US based on the [FEMA dataset](https://www.fema.gov/api/open/v1/DisasterDeclarationsSummaries.csv)
 - An interface using this API to present the data distributed over time and location

It's open-ended on purpose :)

Youâ€™re free to use the languages, frameworks and libraries of your choice.

This is a simple exercise, but organize, design and test your code as if it was going to be put in production.

Here are some core requirements:

 - Build filtering by dates and type of disaster
 - Allow visualization on a map
 - The service should be deployed and accessible without any local setup
 - You will need to share access to the repository

Don't hesitate to ask pertinent questions.

Please share with us your private repo on github/bitbucket/whatever so that we can track your progress and see your commit history.

Attached, an idea of what could be used for the map data visualization part.
